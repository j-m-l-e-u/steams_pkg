Attention-based data fusion for spatial prediction using several mobile sensors
============================================================================================

Based on a synthetic spatial phenomena, and several synthetic sensors, we test different types of attention-based and transforemer-based data fusion.

- kriging and Nadaraya-Watson w/ weight described as a constant or non-constant over space
- dot prod attention
- transformer encoder
- transformer encoder-decoder
